### Reflection

# This was a fun exercise for me because it actually helped me with my current job. I am helping run the intranet for a business out in Arizona
# which pulls financial and business data from a Microsoft SQL Server. It uses the same query language (SQL) so I was relatively familiar with some of # the commands. I also learned new things like joining and HAVING that I was not familiar with. I also am extremely excited SQL is standardized as one # of the websites I am working on has a MySQL database and not an MSSQL one.
#
# Being able to query and sort through data is an absolutely imperative skill set for any developer in my opinion. To be able to quickly look through # #your apps databases helps debug and tighten up the system.
